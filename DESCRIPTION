Description: Input mixed variable data in the form of a data frame or, if all numeric data, a matrix. Other inputs: 
var.type.vec is a vector with elements indicating each variable type in the data frame/matrix object; 
var.weight.vec (optional) is a vector with elements indicating variable weights applied in Gower Distance 
calculations (see details of gower.dist() from gower package for more information); dend (optional) is a boolean 
input, "TRUE" indicating dendrogram plot is a desired output, "FALSE" otherwise. For more information on inputs, 
see details of Gower_Cluster() from this package. Intended use of this package is to provide relatively simple 
operations to prepare data frame objects of mixed variable data for Gower Distance computations, output pairwise 
Gower Distances between observations, and provide certain exploratory cluster analysis tools to explore potential 
clusterings of the mixed variable type data.
